2. Initialize the variable NumberOfCourses with data type int;
3. Prompt user to enter number of courses offered using, "Enter the number of courses you offer:";
4. Take user input from keyboard and store inside the NumberOfCourses variable;
5. Initialize the variable TotalScore and TotalCredit with datatype int and default value of 0;
6. Start a for loop for every instance the variable i is less than or equal to the number of courses where i starts from 1;
7. The loop will have the prompt, "What is your grade for course" (i);
8. initialize the variable score with the datatype int;
9. store user input from the keyboard inside the variable;
10. initialize variable CreditScore with datatype int;
11. Prompt user to enter credit score for the course i, with "Enter credit score for course" (i);
12. add CreditScore to TotalCredit using TotalCredit += CreditScore;
13. Use an if statement to check if the score is less than 50 to display "Your grade is F" on the console;
14. Introduce an else if to check if the score is more than or equal to 50 and less than 60 using (score >= 50 && score < 60) and display the message "Your grade is D";
15. Introduce another else if to check if score is more than or equal 60 and less than 70 and display the message "Your grade is C";
16. Introduce another else if to check if score is more than or equal to 70 but less than 80;
17. Add an else to check if score is greater than or equal to 80 and also less than equal to 100 and display the message "Your grade is A";
18. Update the TotalScore by adding the product of score and CreditScore, expressed as TotalScore += (score * CreditScore);
19.Outside the for loop, initialize the variable SemesterAverage with datatype double;
20. Set SemesterAverage = TotalScore / TotalCredit;
21. Display the semester average using, "Your semester average is ", SemesterAverage;
22. Display a thank you message, "Thank You For Using The GCTU Grading System";
